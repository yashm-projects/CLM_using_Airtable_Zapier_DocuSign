📂 Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) with Airtable & Zapier


**⚠ Disclaimer**
All data, documents, vendor details, and contract examples in this project are dummy/sample data created for learning and demonstration purposes only. This setup is not intended for use with real contracts or sensitive information without proper validation and security measures.

✅ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet scalable Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) solution using Airtable as the data platform and Zapier for automations and integrations with external tools like DocuSign.

The solution helps organizations manage contract creation, approval workflows, tracking, and renewal reminders — while reducing manual tasks, improving compliance, and enhancing visibility.

📘 Key Features Implemented

✔ Centralized contract database with linked tables for vendors and approvals
✔ Intuitive dashboards built using Airtable’s Interface Designer
✔ Automated notifications and updates using Airtable’s automation features
✔ Integration with DocuSign via Zapier to send contracts for signature automatically
✔ Renewal reminders and expiry tracking through formulas and automation
✔ Scalable and easy-to-use workflows for non-technical users
✔ Documentation and training-ready interfaces to improve adoption
